# SOC-artificial-neural-network
This is an entirely new and unique approach mimicking artificial neural networks from a brain-inspired model's point of view. I have used advanced mathematical frameworks from statistical physics and unique simulation techniques. So, this is a neve-forseen interplay between statistical physics and artificial neural networks.
