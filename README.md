# Self-Organized Criticality in Artificial Neural Networks 
This is an entirely new and unique approach mimicking artificial neural networks from a brain-inspired model's point of view. I have used advanced mathematical frameworks from statistical physics and unique simulation techniques. So, this is a neve-forseen interplay between statistical physics and artificial neural networks.

# Introduction to First Passage Processes
The first passage process is a special type of random walk, i.e., a stochastic process. It serves as a fundamental framework in stochastic dynamics, enabling the analysis of probabilities and typical times for particles or complex systems to reach specific thresholds. This model finds widespread application across diverse disciplines, ranging from physics, mathematics to neuroscience and financial markets. The applicability of first passage processes extends into the realm of financial markets, where it finds resonance in stock market trading strategies. For instance, the execution of buy/sell orders hinges on the moment when stock prices initially breaches a predefined threshold. In modern trading practices, algorithms that take advantage of the principles of first passage processes, such as trade bots, captilalize on such fluctuations. 

The first passage probability, F(r, t), represents the probability that a random walk or a diffusing particle arrives at a particular site (or set of sites) for the first time during a specified time frame t, starting from the origin. In essence, it quantifies the probability of zero crossings and captures the probability distribution of the first arrival times of a random walk. On the other hand, the occupation probability, P(r, t), represents the probability that a random walk occupies a particular site r at time t, given that it started from the origin. F(r, t) accounts for the cumulative probability of the random walks being present at the site r at any given time t.
